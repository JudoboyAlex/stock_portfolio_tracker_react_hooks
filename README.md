## Stock Portfolio Tracker

Personal stock portolio tracker developed using react hooks with Finn hub stock api and interactive chart from Tradingview. If you have different sets of stock portfolios with several brokerages, you can combine all your portfolios and view the performance in this app instead of browsing through bunch of different statements. This app uses local storage to save your portfolio data. In the future, I would like to make real-time stock trading platform.   

## Demo

Use the app online at [https://stock-portfolio-tracker.netlify.app/](https://stock-portfolio-tracker.netlify.app/)

## Run App Locally

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
